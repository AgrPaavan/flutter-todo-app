# Flutter To-Do App

This is a simple To-Do app built with Flutter. It allows users to add tasks, mark them as completed, and delete tasks. The app uses [Hive](https://pub.dev/packages/hive) as the local database to maintain data across sessions, providing persistent storage even when the app is closed.

## Features

- **Add To-Do**: Add a new task to the list.
- **Mark as Completed**: Mark a task as completed by tapping on it.
- **Delete To-Do**: Remove tasks from the list when they are no longer needed.
- **Persistent Storage**: All tasks are stored locally using Hive, ensuring that data remains intact across app sessions.
